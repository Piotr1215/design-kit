description: "Create a master implementation plan: components, three-phase breakdown, optional Linear binding"
---

Create a master implementation plan following the design-kit philosophy: test-driven, parallel execution, contract-based integration.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Determine slug for this project. Order:
#    a) If args contain a Linear project URL, derive slug from project name (kebab-case)
#    b) Else if --slug <name> passed in args, use that
#    c) Else prompt user: "Project slug (kebab-case, e.g. docs-config-automation)?"
SLUG="<derived-or-prompted>"

# 2. Bind this repo to the project (creates global spec dir + local pointer)
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/auto-connect-design.sh" --init "$SLUG"

# 3. Compute paths
SPEC_DIR="$HOME/.claude/specs/$SLUG"
PLAN_FILE="$SPEC_DIR/PLAN.md"

# 4. Check if PLAN.md already exists
if [[ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: PLAN.md already exists at $PLAN_FILE"
    echo "   The project '$SLUG' already has a plan."
    echo "   To recreate: rm $PLAN_FILE"
    echo "   To bind THIS repo to that existing project without recreating: just keep going — the pointer was set."
    exit 1
fi
```

**Path model**: plans are stored globally at `~/.claude/specs/<slug>/`, not per-branch in the current repo. Each repo that participates in the project drops a pointer file `<repo>/.claude/current-project` containing the slug. Multiple repos and multiple branches can share one plan — Phase 1 proofs and Phase 2 task files all live in the global location.

## Task Description

Given project requirements: `{ARGS}`

## FIRST: Detect Current Phase

**Before creating PLAN.md, determine project state:**

1. Check `$SPEC_DIR/proofs/` - any proofs exist?
2. Check `$SPEC_DIR/tasks/` - any tasks exist?
3. Determine appropriate action based on findings

## Core Philosophy

1. **Incremental Testing**: Start with happy path, add tests one-by-one, run ALL tests every time (catch regressions early)
2. **Test-Driven**: Sufficient diverse test runs to validate requirements BEFORE writing documentation
3. **Parallel Execution**: ALL Phase 1 tasks must be 100% independent (zero dependencies)
4. **Contract-Based**: Phase 2 uses ONLY CONTRACT.md + TESTING.md (never internals)
5. **Proof-First**: Validate approaches in isolation BEFORE integration
6. **Iterative Integration**: Integration may uncover issues → refine Phase 1 proof → re-integrate (this is NORMAL)
7. **Requirement-Driven Testing**: Test coverage based on what can go wrong, not arbitrary numbers

## Create PLAN.md Structure

Write to `$SPEC_DIR/PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Overview
[What are we building? Why?]

## Components (Phase 1 - Parallel Proofs)

Each component must be:
- 100% independent (can run in parallel)
- Test-driven (sufficient tests to validate requirements before docs)
- Contract-ready (produces CONTRACT.md + TESTING.md)

### Component List
1. [Component A] - [What needs to be proven?]
2. [Component B] - [What needs to be proven?]
3. [Component C] - [What needs to be proven?]

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Research (Parallel)
- All tasks run simultaneously
- Each proves ONE component works in isolation
- Uses generic/sample test data (NOT real system data)
- Deliverables: CONTRACT.md, TESTING.md, test runs sufficient to validate requirements

### Phase 1.5: Feedback Loop
- Review all FEEDBACK.md files from proofs
- Update this PLAN.md based on discoveries
- Adjust Phase 2 if needed

### Phase 2: Integration (Sequential if needed, ITERATIVE by nature)
- Connect proven components to actual system
- Use ONLY contracts from Phase 1 (black-box)
- Re-run Phase 1 test harness with REAL data
- **EXPECT iteration**: Integration often uncovers issues not found in isolation
- When issues found → create TASK-P1-X-REFINEMENT.md → refine proof → re-integrate
- **This back-and-forth is NORMAL and EXPECTED in real engineering**

## Testing Emphasis

**CRITICAL**: Testing is the PRIMARY deliverable, not documentation.

For each component:
- Design EFFECTIVE testing strategy first (what can go wrong in YOUR use case?)
- **CHECK MEMORY MCP** for proven test harness setups (e.g., `Playwright_Quick_Setup_Guide`)
- Implement test harness (run.sh)
- **Develop tests INCREMENTALLY:**
  - Start with ONE happy-path test
  - Add one test at a time (edge case, failure mode, invariant)
  - Run ALL tests after each addition (catch regressions immediately)
  - Build confidence iteratively until reliability requirements met
- Collect results (pass/fail logs, metrics)
- THEN write docs based on empirical evidence
- **ADD TO MEMORY** if you created a novel test harness (save future agents hours of setup)

**Focus on test design quality and incremental development over arbitrary test counts.**

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 complete when:
- [ ] All components have CONTRACT.md + TESTING.md
- [ ] All test harnesses achieve acceptable pass rate (documented in TESTING.md with rationale)
- [ ] All FEEDBACK.md files reviewed

Phase 2 complete when:
- [ ] Integration with real system data works
- [ ] Phase 1 harness re-run passes with real data
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
```

## Key Principles

1. **NO implementation code in PLAN.md** - just high-level component breakdown
2. **Short and focused** - agent gets creative freedom in approach
3. **Clear success boundaries** - "done when reliability requirements are validated"
4. **Test strategy must be automatable** - no manual validation
5. **Requirement-driven testing** - test coverage based on what can fail, not arbitrary numbers

## Linear Project Binding (after PLAN.md is written)

The kit can mirror the plan to a Linear project so the team sees the same source of truth. Local files remain the working artifacts (`/design-kit:dd-research-tasks`, `/design-kit:dd-integration-tasks` read from disk); Linear is the visible mirror that agents can also pull from when working off a Linear issue.

### Detection (in order)

1. **Existing sidecar**: `$SPEC_DIR/linear.yaml` — already bound, update the doc
2. **Args**: parse a `linear.app/.../project/<slug>` URL from `{ARGS}`
3. **Env var**: `LINEAR_PROJECT_ID` set
4. **Prompt user**: "Linear project to bind (name, URL, ID, or 'skip')?"

### When bound — after writing PLAN.md

1. Create or update Linear document attached to project:
   - Title: `Implementation plan — <project name>`
   - Content: full PLAN.md (no local-machine paths, no dates)
   - Tool: `mcp__linear-server__save_document` (project=<id>, title=..., content=...)
2. Read project milestones: `mcp__linear-server__get_project(includeMilestones: true)` and capture each milestone ID by name (M1, M2, M3 conventionally)
3. Write `$SPEC_DIR/linear.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   project_id: <uuid>
   project_url: https://linear.app/<workspace>/project/<slug>
   plan_doc_id: <uuid>
   plan_doc_url: https://linear.app/<workspace>/document/<slug>
   team: <TEAM-KEY>            # e.g. DEVOPS
   milestones:
     M1: <uuid>                # name → id mapping
     M2: <uuid>
     M3: <uuid>
   research_milestone: M1      # /design-kit:dd-research-tasks issues land here
   integrate_milestone: M3     # /design-kit:dd-integration-tasks issues land here
   issue_map: {}               # filled in by /design-kit:dd-research-tasks and /design-kit:dd-integration-tasks
   ```
4. Echo: `Plan synced to Linear: <plan_doc_url>`

### MCP requirement

Requires `mcp__linear-server__*` tools. If MCP is unreachable, **DO NOT silently skip** — print:

```
❌ Linear MCP not reachable. Either:
   - fix the MCP server, OR
   - run with LINEAR_SKIP=1 to bypass and work local-only
```

Exit non-zero so the user notices.

### Skipping

If user passes `LINEAR_SKIP=1` or answers "skip": work local-only. PLAN.md still written. No sidecar created.

### What gets put inside a Linear issue (referenced from `/design-kit:dd-research-tasks` and `/design-kit:dd-integration-tasks`)

Every Linear issue created by the toolchain must include this header:

```markdown
## Source artifacts

- **Master plan**: [Implementation plan — <project>](<plan_doc_url>)
- **Local task file** (for tools, when working from a checkout): `~/.claude/specs/<slug>/tasks/<task-file>.md`

## How to use this issue

1. Pull the master plan from the Linear document above (link is the source of truth)
2. Read this issue body for component-specific instructions
3. Local scratch space (any machine that has the project bound): `~/.claude/specs/<slug>/proofs/<component>/`
4. When done, comment on this issue with summary + PR link, then mark Done
```

## Next Steps

After PLAN.md is created and (optionally) Linear-bound:
- Run `/design-kit:dd-research-tasks` to generate Phase 1 parallel proof tasks
- Complete all Phase 1 tasks independently
- Run `/design-kit:dd-replan-after-research` to fold FEEDBACK into PLAN
- Run `/design-kit:dd-integration-tasks` to generate Phase 2 integration tasks
